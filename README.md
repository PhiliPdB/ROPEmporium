# ROPEmporium

These are my solutions to the [ROPEmporium](https://ropemporium.com) challenges. I solved all these challenges for both 32 and 64 bit binaries. All these exploits are written in Python and make use of [Pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools), although I also manually wrote a lot the payloads. These can be found in the history of this project.
